# Predicting Stockouts with Machine Learning: A Case Study on Seasonal Demand

**Overview:**

This project investigates the application of machine learning to predict demand for seasonal inventory items and minimize stockouts.  The analysis focuses on accurately forecasting demand fluctuations throughout the year, enabling businesses to optimize inventory levels and avoid both overstocking and shortages.  The project utilizes historical sales data to train a predictive model and evaluates its performance using appropriate metrics.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key performance indicators (KPIs) of the predictive model to the console, including metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualizations, including:

* `sales_trend.png`: A line plot showing the historical sales trend and the model's predictions.  This visualizes the model's accuracy in capturing seasonal patterns.
* *(Other plot files as generated by the analysis)*:  Other visualizations may be generated depending on the specific analysis performed, providing further insights into the data and model performance.


**Data:**

*(Optional: Add a section describing the data used, its source, and any preprocessing steps.)*  For example:  "The dataset used in this project consists of [description of data] obtained from [data source].  Data preprocessing included [mention preprocessing steps like handling missing values, outlier detection, feature scaling etc.]"


**Future Work:**

*(Optional: Add a section outlining potential future improvements or extensions to the project.)* For example: "Future work could involve exploring more advanced time series models, incorporating external factors like weather data or marketing campaigns, and implementing a real-time forecasting system."
